AMAP (Application Mapper) - Simple Guide for Kali Linux

📌 What is AMAP?
AMAP is a powerful tool used in penetration testing to identify applications running on open ports, even if those applications are using non-standard ports.

🎯 Why use AMAP?
- To identify services running on ports (even if the port is not default, like HTTP on port 8080).
- To recognize non-ASCII-based applications.
- To map and analyze network services more accurately.

🛠️ How to Install:
Run the following command in your Kali terminal:
    sudo apt install amap

✅ Basic Usage:
To see help options:
    amap -h

📥 Scan a single IP with known open ports:
    amap <target IP> <port>
Example:
    amap 192.168.1.1 80

📥 Scan multiple ports on a target:
    amap 192.168.1.1 21 22 80 443

📥 Scan using a port list file:
Create a file called ports.txt with a list of ports (one per line), then run:
    amap -bq -f ports.txt 192.168.1.1

📂 Save the output to a file:
    amap -o output.txt 192.168.1.1 80

🔍 More Options:
    amap -A <IP>     : Aggressive scan mode
    amap -B <IP>     : Banner grab only
    amap -v <IP>     : Verbose mode (more details)

📌 Example:
    amap -A 192.168.0.105 21 22 80
This command will aggressively scan ports 21, 22, and 80 on 192.168.0.105 and try to identify services.

🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation):
1. AMAP sends a "trigger" packet to each port.
2. It checks how the server responds.
3. Based on the response, it compares it with known application signatures.
4. If it finds a match, it tells you which service is running.

📘 Notes:
- Best used after discovering open ports using `nmap`.
- Does not replace `nmap` but works well with it.

That's it! You're now ready to start using amap for basic application fingerprinting.
