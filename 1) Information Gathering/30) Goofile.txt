1) What is Goofile?
Goofile is an information-gathering utility in Kali Linux that leverages web search engines to locate files of a specific filetype hosted on a target domain. 
It automates Google-style dorking to find documents (PDFs, DOCs, XLS, etc.) and is useful for quickly discovering exposed sensitive documents or public resources within a domain.

2) Why use Goofile?
â€¢ Discover Exposed Documents â†’ Find leaked PDFs, internal docs, or configuration files indexed on the web.  
â€¢ Recon Efficiency â†’ Automates targeted filetype searches across a domain instead of manual search engine queries.  
â€¢ Data Discovery â†’ Useful for finding reports, manuals, or sensitive information during reconnaissance.  
â€¢ Filtering by Keyword â†’ Combine filetype search with keywords to narrow down results.

3) How does Goofile work?
1. Constructs search queries (dorks) targeting a specific domain and filetype (e.g., site:example.com filetype:pdf).  
2. Uses web search results (Google or a configured Custom Search Engine) to collect links to matching files.  
3. Parses and lists the discovered file URLs for review or download.  
4. Optionally accepts an API key and engine ID for authenticated/custom search access to improve reliability.

Note: When no API key/engine is provided, Goofile may rely on scraping public search results which can be rate-limited or blocked.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Context:
Search for PDF files on the domain kali.org.

Command:
goofile -d kali.org -f pdf

Flags explained:
â€¢ -d, --domain DOMAIN â†’ Domain to search (optional but commonly used).  
â€¢ -f, --filetype FILETYPE â†’ Filetype to search for (required, e.g., pdf, doc, xls).  
â€¢ -k, --key KEY â†’ Google Custom Search API key (optional; improves reliability).  
â€¢ -e, --engine ENGINE â†’ Google Custom Search Engine ID (optional).  
â€¢ -q, --query QUERY â†’ Add keyword filter to search results.  
â€¢ --logging LOGGING â†’ Set logging verbosity (optional).

Observed Response (example):
Searching in kali.org for pdf
Files found:
docs.kali.org/pdf/kali-book-fr.pdf
docs.kali.org/pdf/kali-book-en.pdf
docs.kali.org/pdf/articles/kali-linux-live-usb-install-en.pdf
...

Interpretation:
Goofile located publicly indexed PDF files hosted under kali.org and listed their paths. These can be reviewed or downloaded for reconnaissance or evidence of exposed content.

5) Practical Workflow

Step 1: Install Goofile
sudo apt update
sudo apt install goofile

Step 2: Run a basic domain filetype search
goofile -d example.com -f pdf

Step 3: Add keyword filtering (optional)
goofile -d example.com -f pdf -q "password"

Step 4: Use API key/engine for improved results (optional)
# Create a Google Custom Search Engine and supply API key and engine ID
goofile -d example.com -f pdf -k YOUR_API_KEY -e YOUR_ENGINE_ID

Step 5: Review and download discovered files
# Save output to file for later analysis
goofile -d example.com -f pdf | tee goofile_results.txt

Step 6: Analyze files
# Download and inspect documents for sensitive info in a controlled environment.

6) Limitations
â€¢ Depends on search engine results: If files are not indexed, they won't be found.  
â€¢ Rate limiting / blocking: Scraping search results without API keys can lead to IP blocks.  
â€¢ False positives: Some results may point to dynamic pages or redirects instead of actual files.  
â€¢ Legal/Ethical: Downloading or using discovered files may violate privacy or terms of serviceâ€”only access files you are authorized to review.  
â€¢ Limited to filetypes: Only finds files exposed via search engines; not a replacement for direct network discovery.

7) Summary
â€¢ What: Tool to search for specific filetypes hosted on a domain using search engine queries.  
â€¢ Why: Quickly find exposed documents and sensitive files during reconnaissance.  
â€¢ How: Generates dork-like queries (site + filetype), queries search engine (optionally via API), parses results, and lists file URLs.  
â€¢ Use Case: Searched kali.org for PDFs and listed several pdf file paths for review.
