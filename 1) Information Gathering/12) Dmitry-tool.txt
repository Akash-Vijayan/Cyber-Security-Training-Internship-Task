2) Why use DMitry?
    â€¢ Quickly gathers multiple types of reconnaissance data in one tool.
    â€¢ Useful for footprinting in cybersecurity and penetration testing.
    â€¢ Helps identify domain registration details, name servers, and emails.

3) How does DMitry work?
    1. You provide the target domain or IP address.
    2. DMitry runs WHOIS lookups, performs TCP port scans, and collects emails/subdomains.
